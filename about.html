      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Elisa, and I am a 24-year-old student currently
        pursuing my Bachelor's degree in ICT/Software at Fontys University of
        Applied Sciences. <br />
        Another interesting aspect of my background is that I am half Spanish,
        which is why I have two last names. While I typically only use my first
        last name in most situations, I am proud of my Spanish heritage and the
        unique cultural perspective it has given me. Although I don't speak
        Spanish fluently, I have a deep appreciation for the language. <br />
        During my gap year, I discovered a passion for Front End Development
        through SheCodes, and I have been exploring this interest ever since.
        When I'm not studying or coding, I enjoy spending time outdoors, taking
        long walks in nature, and playing video games. Thanks for taking the
        time to learn a bit about me! In addition to my academic pursuits and
        personal interests, I have also gained valuable experience working both
        independently and as part of a team. I have spent time working in the
        hospitality sector, where effective communication and collaboration are
        crucial to providing excellent service to clients. These experiences
        have taught me how to work through issues with both clients and team
        members in a professional and respectful manner. Whether I am working on
        a group project or tackling a task on my own, I am confident in my
        ability to communicate effectively, stay organized, and meet deadlines.
