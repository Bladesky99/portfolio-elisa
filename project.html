            The weather app that I have created is designed to provide accurate
            and up-to-date weather information to users. It retrieves location
            and weather data using an API, ensuring that users have access to
            the most relevant information possible. Additionally, the app can
            switch between day and night themes, depending on the real-world
            time of the user's location, providing an immersive and personalized
            experience. With this app, users can quickly and easily check the
            weather and stay informed about current and upcoming weather
            conditions in their area.

          <h2 class="mb-3 text-start">Gecko site</h2>
          <p class="text-start">
            The website that I created is all about geckos. As my first project
            on SheCodes, it taught me how to incorporate different elements into
            a website. The site features a button that, when clicked, prompts
            the user to answer a series of questions about themselves to
            determine if they are eligible to adopt a gecko. Once the questions
            are answered, the site uses innerHTML to display a message
            indicating whether the user can adopt a gecko or if they need to ask
            their parents first. This website is a great way to learn about
            geckos and is a fun and interactive way for users to engage with the
            content.

          <p class="text-start">
            The world clock website that I created is a useful tool for people
            who need to keep track of time in different parts of the world. This
            project focused on the formatting of time and dates using an API and
            moment.js. The site displays the current times of various cities
            around the world, making it easy for users to see what time it is in
            different time zones. It also features a drop-down menu where users
            can select a city of their choice to display just the time of that
            particular city. The site is user-friendly and provides a clean and
            simple layout, making it easy for users to navigate and find the
            information they need.

      <p class="reflection">
        The projects mentioned above are a part of my experience in the SheCodes
        Front-end course, where I focused my attention for the last few months
        to learn a new skill during my gap year. Throughout the course, I worked
        on a number of smaller projects and challenges that taught me best
        practices, such as implementing good SEO to my projects and making them
        responsive. One of my most notable projects was the creation of my own
        portfolio website, of which I am incredibly proud. I was able to make
        significant progress in a very short amount of time and feel excited
        about all the skills I will learn in the future. As I move forward in my
        journey to become a skilled front-end developer, I hope that you can see
        my potential as much as I do.
